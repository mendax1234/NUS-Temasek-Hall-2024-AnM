## Notes from ur elves 📜

### **The Elves' Riddles** 🧝‍♀️🧩

Dearest darling, the words before you are not mere mortal writings ✍️. No, these sacred texts date back to the legendary **First Age** 🕰, a time when we elves had an irresistible love 💖 for riddles and puzzles 🧩. What you see is a carefully woven riddle, a magical key 🔑 that will guide you to uncover part of **ur angel’s** name (This name is the one the others usually used to call your angel 😇, not his surname! 📝💖) 🧠🔍. Let your mind dance with the mystery, as only you can unravel its secrets! 🌟💫

### **The Language Barrier** 🌐🧝‍♂️

Ah, these ancient tomes 📚 were penned in our graceful tongue, [**Sindarin**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] 🧝‍♂️🗣, a language of beauty and elegance 🌿 and using [**Tengwar**](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] to write. Though we have humbly attempted to bring these words into your familiar English 🗣, we confess, our grasp is not flawless 😅. There may be subtle twists and turns that challenge you. But we know your brilliance will shine through! 💖✨

***

But fret not, my beloved darlingggg 💕💖! The **kind-hearted elves** 🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️ have worked their magic ✨ and translated the mysterious **Sindarin** language 🧝‍♂️🌿 into **English** 🗣. However, even with all their wisdom, they couldn’t quite manage to translate everything perfectly from **Tengwar** 🔠 to modern English letters ✍️.

But don’t worry! They’ve uncovered a **special table** 📜 from their books that shows the exact **rules** for doing just that! 🧩✨

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/hint-1-table.png" alt="" width="443"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**For example**,  <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" data-size="line"> is "**ee"** and it represents **"e"** in English, <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> is "**t**" in English, <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="" data-size="line"> is "**r**" in English.

[^1]: Sindarin is an Elvish language created by J.R.R. Tolkien, spoken by the Grey Elves in Middle-earth. It evolved into the everyday language of Elves by the Third Age, featuring Welsh-like sounds and a flowing phonology.

[^2]: Tengwar is a script created by J.R.R. Tolkien, primarily used to write the languages of Middle-earth, such as Quenya and Sindarin. The elegant, flowing letters are designed to represent both vowels and consonants in various languages. Each character, or tengwa, is adaptable, allowing for different modes depending on the language being transcribed. While originally created for Elvish languages, Tengwar can also be used to write English and other tongues with specific modifications.
