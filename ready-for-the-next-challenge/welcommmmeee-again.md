<details>

<summary>Why did we eat the awfulllychocolate? (Where was ur angel)</summary>

It's a long story. One day, we were wandering through Middle-earth 🏞️ when our excellent sense of smell led us straight to the leftover awfullychocolate 🍫 on your angel's table! Next to it was a mysterious black circle with the word[ "mretdim" ](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]written on it 🖤🔍. Along with it was the quote you’ve seen before. We were SHOCKED and TERRIFIED 😱😰 because that symbol means Sauron[^4], the Enemy, has returned to Middle-earth!!! 😈🌍 But… we couldn't let that heavenly awfullychocolate go to waste! 😏🍫 So, we decided to eat it first before we help you find your angel and stop Sauron's evil plan! 💪✨ HAHAHAHA! 🤣

[^1]: In _The Lord of the Rings_, Men (humans) are one of the main races of Middle-earth. They are known for their shorter lifespans compared to Elves and Dwarves

[^2]: The Elves were the most beautiful beings in Middle-Earth, much more attractive than humans. They were usually tall, with elf women rarely shorter than six feet and elf men at least six and a half feet tall. 🌟✨

    Elves had sharper senses than humans, were graceful but also strong, and could handle harsh conditions, illness, and disease better.

    Sometimes, humans were mistaken for Elves (like Túrin Turambar), so the differences between them must have been small. 👀

[^3]: This is the darkest magic ever created by Sauron 😈, and anyone trapped by it will be bound forever 🕸️, unable to break free unless a hero comes to rescue them! 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️✨

[^4]: Sauron is the main villain in _The Lord of the Rings_. He is a powerful, dark sorcerer who wants to rule all of Middle-earth. Long ago, Sauron created the One Ring, a magical ring that gives him control over other powerful beings. Even though Sauron was defeated and lost the ring, his spirit survived, and he is always trying to get it back so he can regain his full strength and take over the world. He doesn't have a physical form anymore, but his evil influence spreads, and he commands armies of orcs and dark creatures to carry out his plans.
