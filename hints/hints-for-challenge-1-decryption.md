# Hints for Challenge 1 - Decryption

## Hint 1

My darling 💖, the first challenge is all about decryption 🔓. To crack this, you need to figure out the encryption algorithm the aliens 👽 are using. This secret is hidden in the Background 📚 section [#captains-log-background](../get-your-happy-meal-back/decrypt-the-alien-captains-log.md#captains-log-background "mention"). Pay extra attention to the emojis 🕵️‍♂️, like 🏛️. These emojis actually reveal the name of the algorithm the aliens 🛸 are using! 🌌✨

## Hint 2

Aww, thank you, darling!! 😘💖 You're the best!! Yes, you're absolutely right—the aliens are using Caesar cipher to encrypt their messages! 👽🔐 To crack their code, you'll need to understand the secret substitution table 🧩📝 for each letter. And guess what? The aliens are using the table below, with a sneaky shift of 9 letters! 🔄🔡 Basically, this means that each decrypted text 📝🔓 is matched up with its corresponding plain text! 🔠✨ It's like a secret code 🕵️‍♂️🔑 where every letter finds its perfect match! 💌💡

| Plain Text | Decrypted Text |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| A          | J              |
| B          | K              |
| C          | L              |
| D          | M              |
| E          | N              |
| F          | O              |
| G          | P              |
| H          | Q              |
| I          | R              |
| J          | S              |
| K          | T              |
| L          | U              |
| M          | V              |
| N          | W              |
| O          | X              |
| P          | Y              |
| Q          | Z              |
| R          | A              |
| S          | B              |
| T          | C              |
| U          | D              |
| V          | E              |
| W          | F              |
| X          | G              |
| Y          | H              |
| Z          | I              |

🚀✨ Good luck, my clever decoder! 🧠💫 You’ve got this! 💪🔥
